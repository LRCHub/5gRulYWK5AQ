Sitting on a boat while I sail away with you
We're finally able to make our dreams come true
Only me and

You and I on a new adventure
Nothing in this life can quite compare
To this friendship we are in until the end

Over and over I thought to myself
Living a life without you I would
Sink to the bottom where we once met
Sing from the bottom of our friendship

Sitting on a boat while I float away with you
We're finally able to make our dreams come true
After all, there's nothing you can't do!

Over and over I thought to myself
Living a life without you I would
Sink to the bottom where we once met
Sing from the bottom of our friendship

Over and over I thought to myself
Living a life without you I would
Sink to the bottom where we once met
Sing from the bottom of our friendship
